* Longitudinal modeling and Cincinnati CF center data were used for estimating seasonal fluctuation in lung function of subjects with CF
* Seasonal variation in lung function existed, compared to international cohorts, the seasonal fluctuations occurred earlier and with greater volatility
* Late summer/winter exhibit highest lung function variability and warrant proactive measures of care at the center level
