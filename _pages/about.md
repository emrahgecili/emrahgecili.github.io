I am an Assistant Professor of Pediatrics at Cincinnati Childrenâ€™s Hospital Medical Center and the University of Cincinnati College of Medicine. My research has focused on the development and validation of biostatistical models incorporating biomarker data aimed at outcomes prediction. Specifically, my interest lies in a variety of both Bayesian and traditional approaches for prediction and estimation models, including multiplicity adjustments for genomic data, as well as covariate modeling of proteomics and imaging as predictors of rapid human lung disease progression.
