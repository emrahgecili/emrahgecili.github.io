I am a post-doctoral fellow in the Division of Biostatistics & Epidemiology of the Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center. I had received my PhD in Statistics from the University of Cincinnati in 2018. My research has focused on the development and validation of biostatistical models incorporating biomarker data aimed at outcomes prediction. Specifically, my interest lies in a variety of both Bayesian and traditional approaches for prediction and estimation models, including multiplicity adjustments for genomic data, as well as covariate modeling of proteomics and imaging as predictors of rapid human lung disease progression. I have received a postdoctoral fellowship from the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation which supported my research on building proteomics-informed prediction modeling for rapid lung function decline in CF.
